# Mini-Project: Landing Page

## Description

Landing Page is a mini project that needs to be created using **HTML** and **CSS**. It aims to collect visitors' contact information. Also it is part of the first module of the edX Front-End Skills Bootcamp.

In this project, I had a chance to practice the CSS box model and properties of position and display. The most challenging part for me was to align the bottom section of the page in accordance. To place the footer at the bottom of the page, value of the position property needs to be set to relative in the body element as well.

In addition to the acceptance criteria given, I added rulesets as follows:

- Adjusted the hover state of `anchor` tags by changing the background and text color.
- Adjusted the hover state of the button tag by changing the `opacity` from 0.8 to 1 when hovered.
- Adjusted the active state of the `button` tag to translate 1px in both coordinates.
- Adjusted the `::selection` pseudo-element.
- Adjusted the `input` tags' background-color, color and border properties.
